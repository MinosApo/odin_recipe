    <p>This classic potato salad is the best. <em>Creamy, tangy, and crunchy, </em>with a hint of spice and sweetness from pickles, it reminds me of my grandmother`s potato salad served every Easter, <br>
        or any time we had barbecue. She alsways dotted it with olives for a finishing touch, and a <em>perfect</em> briny additon.<br> This is the best classic version of good old-fashioned, Southern-style potato salad. Not too much mayonnaise, with just the right amount of tang!<br>
          Serve with grilled or smoked meats, it`s the perfect side dish.</p><br>
